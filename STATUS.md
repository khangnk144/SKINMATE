## 1. What is SKINMATE?

SKINMATE is a **luxury skincare ingredient analysis web application**. Users can:
- **Register/Login** to create a personal account (locked accounts are blocked from logging in).
- **Set their skin type** (Oily, Dry, Sensitive, Combination, Normal).
- **Paste an INCI ingredient list** (the list printed on the back of skincare products) and get a color-coded safety analysis based on their skin type.
- **See product recommendations** that are safe for their skin — products with any ingredient flagged as BAD for the user's skin type are automatically excluded.
- **View and manage their analysis history** — re-analyze past entries or delete individual/all records.
- **Admin users** can manage the full database of ingredients, safety rules, and products, as well as view statistical reports and manage user accounts (lock/unlock/delete).

## 2. File Type Glossary

If you've never coded before, here's what each file extension means and why it exists:

### Code Files

| Extension | Full Name | What It Does |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `.ts` | **TypeScript** | A programming language built on top of JavaScript. It adds "types" — like labels that say "this variable is a number" or "this is a piece of text." This prevents bugs. All backend logic is written in `.ts` files. |
| `.tsx` | **TypeScript + JSX** | Same as `.ts`, but it can also contain **HTML-like code** (called JSX). This is how React/Next.js builds the visual parts of a website — mixing logic and visual layout in one file. All frontend pages and components use `.tsx`. |
| `.js` | **JavaScript** | The original programming language of the web. Browsers can only run JavaScript natively. Some config files still use plain `.js` because they don't need TypeScript's extra features. |
| `.mjs` | **JavaScript Module** | Same as `.js` but explicitly tells the system "this file uses the modern `import/export` style." Used for config files like ESLint and PostCSS. |
| `.css` | **Cascading Style Sheets** | Controls the **visual appearance** of the website — colors, fonts, spacing, sizes, animations. Think of it as the "paint and decoration" of a house. |
| `.prisma` | **Prisma Schema** | A special file that describes your database structure in human-readable format. Prisma (a tool) reads this and creates the actual database tables for you. |
| `.svg` | **Scalable Vector Graphics** | An image format that uses math instead of pixels, so it stays sharp at any size. Used for icons and logos. |

### Configuration Files

| Extension / Name | What It Does |
|------------------|--------------|
| `.json` | **JavaScript Object Notation** — a universal format for storing structured data (like a settings file). Used for project configs (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`). |
| `.toml` | **Tom's Obvious Minimal Language** — another settings file format, simpler than JSON. Used by Prisma for migration locks. |
| `.env` | **Environment Variables** — a secret settings file that stores sensitive info like database passwords and secret keys. **Never shared publicly.** |
| `.gitignore` | Tells Git (the version-tracking tool) which files to **NOT** track — like `node_modules/` (too big) or `.env` (too secret). |
| `.ico` | **Icon file** — the tiny image that appears in the browser tab next to your website title. |
| `.md` | **Markdown** — a simple text formatting language (like this file!). Used for documentation and README files. |

### Special Naming Conventions

| Name | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| `page.tsx` | In Next.js, any file named `page.tsx` inside a folder under `app/` **automatically becomes a web page**. The folder name becomes the URL. |
| `layout.tsx` | A "wrapper" page in Next.js. It defines shared structure (like the navigation bar and footer) that appears on **every page**. |
| `globals.css` | The CSS file that applies styles to the **entire website**, not just one page. |
| `index.ts` | The "entry point" — the first file that runs when you start the backend server. |

## 4. Why is the Code Structured This Way?

### 4.1 — Why are there TWO separate folders (`backend/` and `frontend/`)?

This is called a **"Decoupled Monorepo"** architecture:

- **`backend/`** = The **server**. Think of it like the kitchen in a restaurant. Customers never see it, but it does all the real work — storing data, checking passwords, running analysis logic.
- **`frontend/`** = The **website**. Think of it like the dining room in a restaurant. It's what customers see — the menus, the plates, the decorations.

They are **separated** because:
1. **They do different jobs.** The backend handles data; the frontend handles visuals.
2. **They can be updated independently.** You can redesign the website without touching the database logic.
3. **They communicate over the internet** using "API calls" — the frontend sends requests (like "give me this user's profile") to the backend's URLs, and the backend responds with data.

### 4.2 — Why does the backend have `routes/`, `controllers/`, `services/`, and `middlewares/`?

This is called the **"Layered Architecture"** pattern. Imagine processing a letter at a post office:

1. **`routes/`** = The **mailbox slots**. Each slot has a label (URL like `/api/v1/auth/login`). When a request arrives, it gets sorted to the right slot.
2. **`middlewares/`** = The **security guards**. Before a letter reaches the office worker, guards check IDs. `auth.middleware.ts` checks "are you logged in?" and `admin.middleware.ts` checks "are you an admin?"
3. **`controllers/`** = The **front desk clerks**. They receive the letter, open it, pass the important content to the specialist, and then write the response letter back.
4. **`services/`** = The **specialists**. They do the actual intellectual work — calculating results, talking to the database, hashing passwords.

**Why split it this way?** Because if you ever need to change HOW something works (like switching from PostgreSQL to another database), you only change the service file — the routes and controllers stay the same. Each piece has ONE job, making bugs easier to find.

### 4.3 — Why does the frontend have `app/`, `components/`, and `context/`?

- **`app/`** = **Pages**. Next.js uses "file-based routing." This means: *the folder structure IS your website's URL structure.* If you create `app/login/page.tsx`, your website automatically gets a `/login` page. No extra configuration needed.
- **`components/`** = **Reusable building blocks**. The `Navbar` appears on every page, so instead of copy-pasting the same code into 8 files, you write it once here and import it everywhere.
- **`context/`** = **Shared memory**. When a user logs in on the login page, every other page needs to know "who is logged in." The `AuthContext` stores this information in one central place that all pages can access.

### 4.4 — Why is there a `prisma/` folder inside `backend/`?

**Prisma** is a tool that acts as a translator between your code and the database:
- **`schema.prisma`** = You describe your data in simple English-like syntax (like "a User has a username and a skinType"). Prisma reads this and creates the actual PostgreSQL tables for you.
- **`migrations/`** = Every time you change `schema.prisma` (like adding a new column), Prisma creates a migration file recording what changed. This is like a history book of your database's evolution.
- **`seed.ts`** = A script that fills your database with sample data for testing.

### 4.5 — Why are there `package.json` files?

Every JavaScript/TypeScript project needs a `package.json`. It serves three purposes:
1. **Lists dependencies** — all the external libraries (tools) the project uses (like Express, React, Prisma).
2. **Defines scripts** — shortcuts like `npm run dev` (starts the server) or `npm test` (runs tests).
3. **Stores metadata** — the project name, version, etc.

The `package-lock.json` is auto-generated and locks the exact version of every dependency so that everyone working on the project gets identical code.

### 4.6 — Why are there `tsconfig.json` files?

TypeScript doesn't run directly in the browser or on the server — it must be **compiled** (translated) into JavaScript first. `tsconfig.json` tells the TypeScript compiler HOW to do this translation (which features to enable, where to put the output, etc.).

### 4.7 — Why are there `tests/` files?

Automated tests are programs that run your code with fake inputs and check if the outputs are correct. They act as a **safety net**: every time you change something, you run the tests to make sure you didn't accidentally break existing features.

## 6. Completed Features

### Feature 01: Authentication (Registration & Login)
- **Backend:** Secure password hashing with `bcryptjs`, JWT token generation, `/register` and `/login` endpoints. Login is **blocked for locked accounts** (`isActive: false`) with a clear error message.
- **Frontend:** Luxury split-screen login and register forms with glassmorphism card, form validation, and error handling.
- **Testing:** Full unit tests for auth controller including locked account scenario.

### Feature 02: User Profile & Skin Type Management
- **Backend:** Protected `GET` and `PUT` endpoints for `/api/v1/users/profile`. Auth middleware for route protection.
- **Frontend:** Profile page where users can view and update their username and skin type.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for middleware and user endpoints.

### Feature 03: Core INCI Analysis Engine
- **Database:** Seed script with sample ingredients and skin-type-specific safety rules.
- **Backend:** `POST /api/v1/analysis/check` — parses INCI strings, normalizes names, queries safety rules based on user's skin type. Results are automatically saved to `AnalysisHistory`.
- **Frontend:** Analysis page with split-screen layout, textarea input, color-coded results (🟢 GOOD, 🔴 BAD, ⚪ NEUTRAL), and ingredient descriptions.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for string parsing, rule-matching, and edge cases.

### Feature 04: Safe Product Recommendations
- **Backend:** `GET /api/v1/products/recommendations` — uses a **safety-first filter**: excludes any product that contains an ingredient flagged as `BAD` for the user's skin type. All remaining safe products are returned.
- **Frontend:** "Recommended for You" section on the analysis page, rendered **only after** the user submits an INCI string for analysis. Displays product cards in a responsive grid.
- **Testing:** Unit tests verifying that the returned products contain zero BAD ingredients for the user's skin type.

### Feature 05: Analysis History
- **Backend:**
  - Analysis results are automatically saved to `AnalysisHistory` on every successful check.
  - `GET /api/v1/history` — retrieves past analyses ordered by newest first.
  - `DELETE /api/v1/history/:id` — deletes a specific history entry.
  - `DELETE /api/v1/history` — clears all history for the authenticated user.
- **Frontend:** Luxury history page with:
  - List of past analyses with timestamps.
  - **Re-analyze** button to quickly rerun checks.
  - **Delete** individual entries with confirmation prompt.
  - **Clear All** history option.
  - Responsive layout and smooth animations.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for history retrieval and both deletion endpoints.

### Feature 06: Admin Dashboard — Ingredients, Rules & Products CRUD
- **Backend:** Full Create/Read/Update/Delete endpoints for ingredients, safety rules, and products under `/api/v1/admin/*`. Protected by both `authMiddleware` and `adminMiddleware`.
  - Products accept an INCI string as input; ingredients are auto-resolved (found or created) from the string.
- **Frontend:** Admin panel with sidebar navigation and dedicated management pages for ingredients, rules, and products. Only accessible to `ADMIN` role users.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for admin routes including 403 Forbidden enforcement for non-admin users.

### Feature 07: Admin — User Management & Statistical Reports
- **Database:** `User` model includes `isActive Boolean @default(true)` for account status tracking.
- **Backend:**
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/users` — lists all users (excluding password hash).
  - `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/:id/status` — toggles `isActive` (lock/unlock account).
  - `DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/:id` — permanently deletes a user account.
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/reports` — aggregates: total users, total analyses, skin type distribution.
- **Frontend:**
  - **Users tab:** Data table with Lock/Unlock toggle and Delete button. All destructive actions trigger a **confirmation modal**.
  - **Reports tab:** Summary metric cards (Total Users, Total Analyses) + Pie Chart (skin type distribution via `recharts`).
- **Testing:** Endpoints verified through admin routes test suite.

### Feature 08: Luxury UI/UX Design System
- Applied a premium, high-end design system across all pages using:
  - **Playfair Display** (serif) for headings and **Inter** (sans-serif) for body text (via Google Fonts).
  - Dusty rose and sage green color palette as the core visual language.
  - **Glassmorphism** effects — frosted glass cards with `backdrop-blur` and `border-white/20`.
  - **Gradient aura backgrounds** — soft pink blurred blobs on the home page and key sections.
  - Split-screen layouts on auth and analysis pages.
  - Micro-animations and hover effects throughout.
  - Fully responsive layouts (mobile → tablet → desktop).
  - Next.js `<Image>` configured with `remotePatterns` to support external image hosting (e.g., `i.postimg.cc`).

## 7. How to Start Everything (After a Computer Shutdown)

### Step 1: Start the Database

**A. If this is your FIRST time running the project (or if you deleted the database):**
1. Open **Docker Desktop** and wait for it to start.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to create the database:
```bash
docker run --name skinmate-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=skinmate -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
3. Push the schema and seed the initial data:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db seed
```

**B. For EVERY DAY use (after shutting down your computer):**
You do **NOT** need to seed the data again. Your data is saved.
1. Open **Docker Desktop** and wait for it to start.
2. Open a terminal and simply start the existing database:
```bash
docker start skinmate-postgres
```

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server
Open a terminal inside the `backend/` folder:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The backend will run on **http://localhost:5000**.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend Website
Open a **second** terminal inside the `frontend/` folder:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The website will run on **http://localhost:3000**.

### Step 4 (Optional): Open Prisma Studio
To visually browse your database, open a **third** terminal:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
```
This opens a database viewer at **http://localhost:5555**.

## 8. Next Action Items

- [ ] **Product Scanning (OCR/Image)** — Allow users to upload a photo of a product label to automatically extract the INCI ingredient list.
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering** — Let users filter analysis results or products by category, brand, or safety rating.
- [ ] **Weighted Scoring System** — Rank recommendations by a composite score based on the number and weight of GOOD ingredients, not just the absence of BAD ones.
- [ ] **Deployment** — Deploy the app to a cloud hosting service (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend) so others can access it online.
